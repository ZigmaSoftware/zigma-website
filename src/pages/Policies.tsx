            </div>

            <h3>What is Money Laundering?</h3>
            <p>Money laundering is the process by which offenders disguise the original ownership and control of the proceeds of criminal conduct by making such proceeds appear to have derived from a legitimate source.</p>

            <h3>The Three Components of Money Laundering</h3>

            <div className="policy-key-info">
              <h4>1. Placement</h4>
              <p>Money generated from illegal/criminal activity is disposed of by depositing into financial institutions or converting into negotiable instruments.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="policy-key-info">
              <h4>2. Layering</h4>
              <p>Funds are moved between accounts to hide their origin and separate illegally obtained assets from their original source through complex transactions.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="policy-key-info">
              <h4>3. Integration</h4>
              <p>Illicit funds are reintroduced into the economy and used to purchase legitimate assets, fund businesses, or conduct other criminal activity.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Red Flags to Report</h3>
            <p>Examples of suspicious activities that should be reported to the CCO include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Customer/vendor provides insufficient, false, or suspicious information</li>
              <li>Payment methods not consistent with policy (money orders, traveller&apos;s checks, multiple instruments)</li>
              <li>Multiple negotiable instruments to pay a single invoice</li>
              <li>Requests to pay in cash</li>
              <li>Early repayments from unrelated third parties</li>
              <li>Orders inconsistent with customer&apos;s business</li>
              <li>Payments from countries with high money laundering/terrorist financing risk</li>
              <li>Payments from tax havens or sanctioned jurisdictions</li>
              <li>Overpayments followed by refund requests to third parties</li>
              <li>Unusually complex business structures with no real business purpose</li>
